## What is eyeshot.xyz?

[eyeshot.xyz](https://eyeshot.xyz) is a visual discovery of the world around us, explored by people like you. Eyeshot's content comes from two sources - Google and explorers (you).

Explore places you never been before. Who knows where you'll end up next ü§©

## Why?

[eyeshot.xyz](https://eyeshot.xyz) is based on Google Street View. I am forever grateful for the gift it is to the web.

The thing is, it helps you in TELEPORTING, not physically but virtually at any random place. It's super fun to explore places where we are not able to go. Through Eyeshot, I just added the randomness and community to it. Now, stop reading and start [exploring](https://eyeshot.xyz).
